On this page I want to share some books that helped me to develop new skills and improve my existing one. I added my personal opinion about it and what I learned while reading it. The stars under the heading indicate how much it helped me. 5 stars indicate a must read.  
I try to keep this list updated as good as possible.

## Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software
:star::star::star::star::star:

### Who should read this?
This book is intended for everyone that is responsible for the operation and the development of a internet facing application. Devs, Operations and DevOps.

### What I learned
* A good software design and good quality helps dramatically to increase the stability of an application.
* Looking at the different stability patterns helps to check if they were considered while building the app.
* Security is an underestimated topic. (see OWASP Top 10)
* Test the happy path. 
* Test all kinds of invalid requests, kill services, literally try to crash your application.
* Have playbooks ready for all kinds of error scenarios.
* Do continous delivery. Small incremental changes are less risky than big bang updates.
