This post is not technical, but I came across this topic and find it very interessting. So I wanted to write a short post about it.

## What is Rai?
Rai, also called stone money, is a valid currency on the tiny island Yap out in the Pacific Ocean. Nowadays the stones are not used as much as in previous days, but using them is still possible.  
A stone looks like a huge disk with a hole in the middle. It is very heavy and hard to transport.

## How does it work?
Every stone has a specific amount of value, based on the history of the stone. When the stone changes its owner, the ownership change is communicated to all the people on the island. Simple, isn't it?

## What does this tell us about currencies?
For me this story show very good how the value of a currency is determined. All the people on the island agreed that they accept Rai stones as currency, so the stones are valuable for them. I think nearly much the same applys to gold, silver, euro, dollar and even Bitcoin.
