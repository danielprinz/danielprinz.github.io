Developing one product with many people (many teams) can be challenging and needs structure. The communication overhead is rising and good coordination has to be done between the teams.

A possible way to master the problem, is to use a scaled up version of the Scrum Framework - the LeSS Framework.
The most things remain the same:

* a single Product Backlog (because itâ€™s for a product, not a team)
* one Definition of Done
* one Potentially Shippable Product Increment at the end of each Sprint
* one Product Owner
* many complete, cross-functional teams (with no single-specialist teams),
* one Sprint

The main difference is, that there are some meetings where all three teams should participate. It may be possible that every person from all three teams is present, but if there are too many people it makes sense that only team representatives take part.

The meetings for all three teams are:

* Sprint Planning 1
* Product Backlog Refinement
* Sprint Review
* Overall Retrospective
