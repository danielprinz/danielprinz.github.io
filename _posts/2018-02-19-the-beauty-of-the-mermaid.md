title: The beauty of the mermaid
---

The fastest and easiest way of creating diagrams and flowcharts is by hand on paper. The problem is that it is hard to update without drawing a whole new diagram and sharing is mostly done by taking a picture.
> There must be a better way!
  
So I looked for an alternative and found a mermaid. Wait what!?
The project is called mermaid and is available on [Github](https://mermaidjs.github.io/).
I was really astonished that it is so easy to write and you can create some really beautiful diagrams with a short amount of text.

## Integrations
### Atom
To preview the mermaid chart locally. It is really useful to use the [atom-mermaid](https://atom.io/packages/atom-mermaid) plugin.

### Gitlab
Because I am using Gitlab to track issues, tasks and documentation, I find it really cool that there is a [out of the box](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#mermaid) support for mermaid.
