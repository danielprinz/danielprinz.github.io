> Until my ONE thing is done, everything else is a distraction - Garry Keller

Because time is a very limited and important resource in our lives, it should be used wisely. Many people want to do too much, or think they have to do that much. Often this leads to frustation, burnout or other diseases.
Giving the tasks a priority and doing the import ones first, helped me a lot. So I want to share my thoughts in this post.

Defining a priority and working on it sound very simple, but in reality we often see something like this:
1. Start with the task
2. Slack nofication
3. Back to task
4. E-Mail
5. Back to task
4. Some other task pops up in the mind
5. Doing other task
6. Oh...

Let's find some reasons why it is hard to concentrate on one specific task:

### The task seems overwhelming
At first the task looks very simple, but when starting it, many obstacles appear. So it is a natural human behaviour (mostly driven by fear to fail) to choose something that is easier.

- *How to improve this?*   
Break down the task in small manageable pieces. The risk of failing is minimized, and even if it did not work out, less time is lost.

- *How does this translate to software development?*    
Doing a big task is hard. Reviewing and Merging long living feature branches is hard again. Using a smaller scope helps enormous to simplify this workflows.

### There are always distractions
Distractions make it hard to concentrate on one task for a long amount of time. Very popular digital distractions are nowadays notifications on the phone, slack and e-mail on the computer. On the other side we all have colleagues chatting about different things in the office. On the personal side the attention of the brain is limited. No human brain can focus 8h in one go.

- *How to improve this?*  
I personally set a timer of 90 minutes for my important tasks and disable all notifactions on the phone for this amount of time. Also all notifications on the pc are disabled when I work on the pc. If there are noises in the office from other people contentration music really helps to keep the focus.

### The why is missing
Just giving a task the highest priority is not enough. For me it must have a "why", a "motivation". What is the result of it? What is the outcome when I did this? If this questions cannot be answered, then the task should be thrown away and the next one can be done from the ToDo list. :)
