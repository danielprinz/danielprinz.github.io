title: What is clean code and why should you care?
---

Right after school I began to work on my first software project. I implemented feature after feature and was happy that it worked. Now my coding is way different than at the beginning. Buy why should you write clean code, when the software is working without it?

> It is very rare that one piece of code is written once and never changed again.

The requirements for the software are changing over time. Adding, changing and removing features is a day to day business. With that in mind, we could define clean code in the following way:

> Clean code is code that is easy to change and easy to understand.

And why should it be easy to understand?
Because most of the time you are reading code, before you can write code. Your co-workers are reading through your code and should also be able to modify it. Therefore with clean code a big amount of time is saved in the future and it is easier to find bugs or even avoid them.

I am always aiming for good code, but we all should keep in mind that code is never perfect. So limit the time when refatoring your code to a good balance between developing new features and keeping your code clean.

A book that i can definitely recommend is [Clean Code from Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.de/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/) . It describes the essential things about clean code every programmer should know.
